            <p>I have had a love of computers since the days of playing barely
            functioning games on the family windows 95' computer. Video games in
            particular have always been a favorite hobby of mine. In High school
            I took classes in video editing and stop-motion animation using a laptop
            I bought and the school's camera. My time in these classes would eventually
            lead me to decide that I wanted to do that kind of work professionally.</p>
                    
                
            <p>I attended Savannah College of Art and Design to study animation, but
            eventually changed my major to interactive design and game development. My
            time in game design was my first real step into the world of how computers 
            worked, although at the time I was still more focused on the artistry rather 
            than the construction. I graduated with a BFA in 2013 but chose to persue other 
            interests in the years after.</p>
                
            <p>During my time in school I took some basic classes on web development
            and programming, but never took it any further than that. In the years since
            then my interest in expanding my understanding of coding has grown and now
            I seek to code professionally. I am looking forward to developing my skills 
            in the months ahead.</p>
